# Skimlit: Medical Abstract Classification

## Overview:
Skimlit is a project aimed at classifying medical abstracts into predefined categories using various machine learning models. The project leverages different text processing techniques, including data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training, to achieve optimal performance in text classification tasks.

## Why Use Machine Learning for Medical Abstract Classification?
